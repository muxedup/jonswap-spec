JONSWAP wave spectrum class

Based on the Pierson-Moskowitz spectrum with an extra peak enhancement factor gamma^r. .

S_j (omega) = ag^2/omega^5 * exp[-1.2 * (omega_p/omega)^4] * gamma^r

Where r is defined as:

r = exp[ -(omega - omega_p)^2 / (2*sigma^2*omega_p^2) ]

and sigma is assigned based on the value of omega vs omega_p:

sigma = 0.07 when omega <= omega_p
	  = 0.09 when omega > omega_p
